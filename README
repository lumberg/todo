# Example of importing encrypted files from S3 into Tddium
#
# 1. Create a new, read-only IAM identity with access just to
#    the bucket and prefix that will host your secure blobs
#
# 2. Use s3store to upload an encrypted blob; you will need to use AWS
#    keys with write permissions for the bucket
#
# 3. Use `tddium config:add` to add configuration values for your new
#    read-only IAM identity to your suite
#
#   a. TDDIUM_S3_REGION		- AWS S3 region, defaults to us-east-1
#   b. TDDIUM_S3_KEY_ID		- AWS S3 secret key ID
#   c. TDDIUM_S3_SECRET		- AWS S3 secret access key
#   d. TDDIUM_S3_PASSPHRASE	- OpenSSL AES passphrase
#
# 4. Download and decrypt the blob and install it from a pre_hook task.
#    See lib/tasks/tddium.rake for an example.
